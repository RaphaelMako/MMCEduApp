# MMCEduApp
Application for managing learners and organizations


At My Media Creative we work to establish interactive and meaningful media campaigns that involve learners in the creative process. 
We believe that the best way to learn creative skills this is by teaching it through purpose driven learning. Over the past year
we have been trying to run a MMC education program and we have finally landed on a method. There are a few different sections that 
one must know to fully understand the workings of the program itself.

# Learners
We are constantly reaching out to youth communities and education centers to get young people involved in our program. Withouth 
learners, we don't have anything. We are constantly looking for new learners and we are always excited to have them join the 
program. However, we need to keep track of all of them. There are seven different things that we want to keep track of:
- their name
- the person who onboarded them
- their past campaigns (if any)
- their current campaign (if any)
- the date they were added
- their contact information
- whether or not they are active or if they're on hold
With this info we can make sure that we are not losing anyone in the crowd and we can actively manage all of the individuals.

# Organizations
Just as important as the learners come the organizations that we work with. To have any campaigns for learners to hop onto we must
have organizations that need our services. Just like learners we are always looking for new organizations that we can work with 
and thus we must have a way of tracking them as well:
- organization's name
- the people who are the main contacts between MMC and the organization
- the campaign description/what they want
- description of the organization as a whole
- the due date of their campaign
- the date we first got in contact with them and they were added to the system
- the organization's contact information
Similarly to the Learners, by tracking the organizations we can facilitate the job for the executives who are responsible for the 
MMC education program.

# Campaigns
We also have the campaigns themselves. Obviously the key to any campaign being executed in a meaningful and efficient way is to 
keep it organized and to make sure that we are able to track all of the different steps of the process:
- we need the organization's name
- the learners that are on the campaign
- the campaign description
- what step of the progress it's at

# General
So moving on to the general set up, we want this to be useable by all people and allow for updates throughout multiple different 
people's computers. Another possible thing that could be added is a log of different updates (however that may prove to be slightly
unecessary, and we will only do it if it seems mandatory). Visually it doesn't need to be stunning from the get go, the main goal 
right now is just going to be getting it up and running. We can start with a purely text file. Moreover, this is just to facilitate
everyone's understanding of what's going on regarding the education campaign and it is to make sure we don't let anyone slip
through the cracks.
